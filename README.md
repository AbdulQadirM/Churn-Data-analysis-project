# Churn-Data-analysis-project

This project focuses on binary classification using a neural network implemented with TensorFlow.
The goal is to predict the binary label of a given input based on a set of features.
The neural network architecture consists of an input layer, a hidden layer with ReLU activation function,
and an output layer with sigmoid activation function.
